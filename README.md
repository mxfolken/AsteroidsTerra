# AsteroidsTerra
Video game for SEGA Saturn.

Asteroids was a popular vector-based Arcade video game released in 1979 by Atari. The objective of the game is to shoot and destroy asteroids while avoiding colliding with their fragments. It was one of the most popular games of the golden age of Arcade video games.

Asteroids was inspired by the Spacewar game, the first computer video game. In 1977 Cinematronics released Space Wars, a similar game, also based on Spacewar. Asteroids is essentially a single-player version of Space Wars, characterized by the ship and asteroids as the main enemy.

For many years of my childhood I played Atari Asteroids, so I thought "Why not program an Asteroids game for the SEGA Saturn console?" That is how this project was born, which I now share in this book, to exemplify programming in the C language for SEGA Saturn.
